            "\n",
            "5. Strain or remove the tea leaves: After steeping, strain the tea leaves out of the teapot using a tea strainer or remove the infuser if you used one.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. Serve: Pour the brewed tea into a cup and enjoy! You can add sweeteners, milk, lemon, or any other additional ingredients to customize your tea to your liking.\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember, the quality of your tea leaves, water, and brewing time will all affect the taste of your tea, so feel free to experiment to find the perfect cup for you!\n"
